	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It is pretty crazy how fast this year has gone by. A lot has happened since. One exact year ago, I remember shooting some hoops and reflecting on 2014. I guess now I&rsquo;m reflecting on 2015 - lots of self-reflection for me.</p>

<ul>
<li>January: LCS season started after an eventful relegation match in 2014 (lol). CLG got fined for poaching Darshan which meant he wasn&rsquo;t allowed to play. Scarra was joining the coaching staff for the first time. I got to play with Benny again :D cause we needed a sub.</li>
<li>February: If I remember correctly we just played a lot of games. This was the meta where Nidalee was broken as hell, and mid Ezreal was seeing a lot of play. I believe this was when we lost to TSM after a solid streak.</li>
<li>March: Azir was also becoming stronger, but a lot of people were still running Leblanc, Lissandra, Corki, etc.</li>
<li>April: Lost 0-3 in playoffs to TeamLiquid rip</li>
<li>May: After much negotiation, drama, I (retired) and left CLG to focus on my studies. There&rsquo;s no point in wasting time I think + League was becoming unenjoyable.</li>
<li>June: Moved in to Berkeley (from Arcadia) with Benny and immediately started summer school at Berkeley City College. Finding apartments is hard (also rent is expensive).</li>
<li>July: Starting school was weird again, but I think BCC was a good stepping stone towards readjusting.</li>
<li>August: Summer school ended (did really well) and for the most part, couldn&rsquo;t want to start classes.</li>
<li>September: Classes at Berkeley started. I was taking CS61A (intro cs class), Math1B (equiv~ Calc BC [on crack apparently]), Phil1 (intro philosophy class), HIS7A (precivilwar US). Freaked out a bit due to the nature and difference of Berkeley classes compared to the rest of the classes I&rsquo;ve ever taken. This was technically my first time actually focusing and taking classes lol. I felt better when studying and think League actually helped me a lot with learning quicker and more efficiently. I&rsquo;ve definitely become a more curious person too.</li>
<li>October: Midterm 1 season - fun stuff. Owned those midterms though and regained my confidence in being capable (which is really important because confidence and mentality define every aspect of your life). I also went to a Kaskade concert.</li>
<li>November: Hard work paid off and got back into Berkeley. Also went to IEM San jose and saw all of CLG again.</li>
<li>December: Started from the bottom (not really) now we here. Hella excited for next semester, because the classes I&rsquo;m taking are truly the gateway classes to all the supposedly cool and most useful classes of Computer Science.</li>
</ul>


<p>I told myself a long time ago &ldquo;Become so good at something you won&rsquo;t be ignored.&rdquo; I did it with League, I&rsquo;m going to try to do it with CS</p>

<p>shoutouts to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Louis for all the support you&rsquo;ve given me in everything and the useful info/help recently that helps make my path to becoming good at CS &lsquo;easier&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Richard for being there to always talk to about league, life, movies, and school.</li>
<li>Youri for the tutoring early in the semester + being the &lsquo;sister&rsquo; I never had.</li>
<li>Benny for best roommate/friend and always there to hang/chill/talk/rant to (oh and best uber driver LOL).
I don&rsquo;t know where I would be without you guys. Thanks for the support.</li>
</ul>


<p>bye 2015</p>
