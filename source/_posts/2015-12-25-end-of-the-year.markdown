It is pretty crazy how fast this year has gone by. A lot has happened since. One exact year ago, I remember shooting some hoops and reflecting on 2014. I guess now I'm reflecting on 2015 - lots of self-reflection for me. 

- January: LCS season started after an eventful relegation match in 2014 (lol). CLG got fined for poaching Darshan which meant he wasn't allowed to play. Scarra was joining the coaching staff for the first time. I got to play with Benny again :D cause we needed a sub. 
- February: If I remember correctly we just played a lot of games. This was the meta where Nidalee was broken as hell, and mid Ezreal was seeing a lot of play. I believe this was when we lost to TSM after a solid streak.
- March: Azir was also becoming stronger, but a lot of people were still running Leblanc, Lissandra, Corki, etc.
- April: Lost 0-3 in playoffs to TeamLiquid rip
- May: After much negotiation, drama, I (retired) and left CLG to focus on my studies. There's no point in wasting time I think + League was becoming unenjoyable.
- June: Moved in to Berkeley (from Arcadia) with Benny and immediately started summer school at Berkeley City College. Finding apartments is hard (also rent is expensive).
- July: Starting school was weird again, but I think BCC was a good stepping stone towards readjusting.
- August: Summer school ended (did really well) and for the most part, couldn't want to start classes.
- September: Classes at Berkeley started. I was taking CS61A (intro cs class), Math1B (equiv~ Calc BC [on crack apparently]), Phil1 (intro philosophy class), HIS7A (precivilwar US). Freaked out a bit due to the nature and difference of Berkeley classes compared to the rest of the classes I've ever taken. This was technically my first time actually focusing and taking classes lol. I felt better when studying and think League actually helped me a lot with learning quicker and more efficiently. I've definitely become a more curious person too. 
- October: Midterm 1 season - fun stuff. Owned those midterms though and regained my confidence in being capable (which is really important because confidence and mentality define every aspect of your life). I also went to a Kaskade concert.
- November: Hard work paid off and got back into Berkeley. Also went to IEM San jose and saw all of CLG again. 
- December: Started from the bottom (not really) now we here. Hella excited for next semester, because the classes I'm taking are truly the gateway classes to all the supposedly cool and most useful classes of Computer Science.

I told myself a long time ago "Become so good at something you won't be ignored." I did it with League, I'm going to try to do it with CS

shoutouts to:

- Louis for all the support you've given me in everything and the useful info/help recently that helps make my path to becoming good at CS 'easier'.
- Richard for being there to always talk to about league, life, movies, and school. 
- Youri for the tutoring early in the semester + being the 'sister' I never had. 
- Benny for best roommate/friend and always there to hang/chill/talk/rant to (oh and best uber driver LOL).
I don't know where I would be without you guys. Thanks for the support.

bye 2015
