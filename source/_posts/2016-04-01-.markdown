I was walking down asian ghetto at night to pick up some Gypsy's. It was a long week filled with midterms and I was feeling kind of meh. This black guy walking right next to me is all happy and giddy and he just starts talking to me asking how I'm doing. I'm like "eh it's going alright." Him? He told me he was happy and feeling super good. Tomorrow is his birthday and I started laughing because well April Fools Day is not a day you want to have a birthday on sometimes. He told me he didn't want tricks to be played on him, but other than that he was feeling pretty pumped. He gave me a fist bump and then walked away. I just smiled as I watched him drove away. Felt good.
