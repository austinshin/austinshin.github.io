I figured making some sort of resolutions or goals or challenges seems like a good way to keep me 'on track' for the year. If things change, at least I will be able to compare it with this post at the end of the year and see how the path was. 

- Start going to the gym (RSF) aka get fit
- 20 pushups, pullups, situps, jumprope daily
- Run 365 Miles
- Try to keep a daily diary of some sort.
- Learn one new thing each day and record it.
- Read at least 15 books outside of classes 
- From these books, learn vocabulary and implement it into daily life.
- Get Yelp Elite
- Stop playing games during the school semester
- Create a side project of some sort in the summer or hopefully do an internship. 
- Do the first 20 projecteuler Problems
- Get to know my professors (aka attend more office hours)
- Get declared as a CS major.

Lots of goals, but it's a lot of small things that add up. But I think I'm off to a good start.
